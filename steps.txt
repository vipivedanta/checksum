CHECKSUM GENERATION
The checksum has to be generated using the following algorithm:
1. Create a Message Digest with ​ SHA-512​ algorithm for the ​ txnReferenceNumber.
2. Create a secret key using the first 32 bytes of the ​ message digest​ and the ​ AES ​ encryption
method.
3. Get a ​ AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding ​ cipher instance.
4. Initialize the cipher in encryption mode with the secret key obtained in ​ step 2​ and a 16
byte Initialization Vector.
5. Generate the ​ validation string​ by concatenating the values of the following fields (in that
order):
a. API User (to be provided separately by XyzPay).
b. API Key (to be provided separately by XyzPay).
c. txnReferenceNumber.
d. customerNumber
e. requestTime
f. walletProviderCode
g. walletNumber
h. amount
6. Encrypt the ​ validation string​ obtained above using the cipher.
7. Apply ​ Base64 encoding ​ to the encrypted value obtained from the previous step.
